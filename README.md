```
{
    "USERNAME": "evitiska@gmail.com",
    "PASSWORD": "a_password"
}
```

### 1. Run Tests in a Docker Container
* Build the Docker image, for example `docker build -t bynder-cypress-tests .`
* Run the tests in a container `docker run bynder-cypress-tests` (add `--rm` to remove container after run)

### 2. Run Tests Manually
* Install dependencies `npm install`
* Run tests script `npm run cypress-tests` (runs all Cypress tests in the `tests` folder with default browser Chrome)

### 3. Run Tests using GitHub Actions

* Option 1: Push a new commit to `main` 
* Option 2: Manually trigger a workflow run:
  * Navigate to GitHub â†’ Actions tab
  * Select the workflow and trigger it manually for a given branch
 
    
### Test Reports
After running the tests, a detailed report is generated using Mochawesome.

* The report can be found in the local directory: `mochawesome-report/reports`
* Screenshots taken during test execution are stored in: `mochawesome-report/assets`
* When using GitHub Actions, the test report can also be downloaded as an artifact from the workflow run.
